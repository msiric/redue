# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.4 — 2026-10-07

- Withdraw automatic npm-launcher applicability because update notifications consume
  unobserved remote/cache/time state. Npm scripts still run and record outcomes.
- Preserve historical PASS/FAIL and require stop/start when upgrading an observer.
  Do not delete receipts. See the [maintainer notice](docs/user/npm-launcher-notice.md).
- Supported Yarn/pnpm and explicit reviewed contracts are unchanged. No agent
  activation or npm direct-compiler recipe is included in this correction.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3 — 2026-10-06

Install: `npm install --global @redue/cli@alpha`.

- Fix selected execution outcomes remaining hidden behind an older observer/cache
  after a missed reload notification. A newer failure must not leave an older
  passing receipt eligible for reuse.
- Withhold applicability during incomplete receipt persistence, unreadable or
  changing selection, and client connections to an older observer.
- Preserve immutable run history. Upgrade requires an observer stop/start;
  receipts need not be deleted. See the [maintainer notice](docs/user/receipt-selection-notice.md).

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 — 2026-10-06

Install: `npm install --global @redue/cli@alpha`.

- npm distribution moved to the product-owned `@redue/cli` package.
- The executable remains `redue`; verification semantics and runtime code are unchanged.
- Alpha.1 (`@msiric/redue`) remains available but is superseded by the canonical package.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 — 2026-10-06

Install: `npm install --global @msiric/redue@alpha`. The command remains `redue`.

- Persistent execution evidence with independent CURRENT, STALE, and UNVERIFIED applicability.
- Node/TypeScript onboarding for npm, supported Yarn node-modules workspaces, and pnpm 12 isolated/hoisted layouts.
- macOS, Linux, and Windows observation with conservative deterministic recovery.
- Human status/explain output, JSON integration contract, and recording-only checks.
- Standard npm tarball installation and scoped state cleanup.

Known limitations include incomplete test/lint/build contracts, uncaptured direct
commands, and synchronized decisions that can cost more than cheap checks. See README.
